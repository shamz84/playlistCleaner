# Google Drive Service Account Setup - SOLUTION REQUIRED

## Current Status âœ…
- âœ… Service account is properly configured 
- âœ… Authentication is working correctly
- âœ… Google Drive API is accessible

## Issue Identified ðŸš¨
**Service accounts cannot upload to their own Google Drive storage**

Error: `Service Accounts do not have storage quota. Leverage shared drives instead.`

## Solution Required ðŸ”§

### Option 1: Create Shared Drive (Recommended)
1. **Go to Google Drive** (drive.google.com)
2. **Create a new Shared Drive:**
   - Click "New" â†’ "Shared drive"
   - Name it: `PlaylistCleaner-Backup`
3. **Add service account as member:**
   - Click "Add members"
   - Enter: `playlistcleanergdautomation@pro-course-469119-d5.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - Set role: **Editor** or **Content manager**
   - Click "Send"

### Option 2: Use Existing Shared Drive
1. Open any existing shared drive
2. Add the service account email as Editor
3. Update the configuration

## After Setup ðŸš€

Once you've created and shared the drive, run:
```bash
C:/Python311/python.exe test_service_account_shared_drive.py
```

This will:
- âœ… Detect the shared drive automatically
- âœ… Test upload functionality
- âœ… Save configuration for future use

## Service Account Email ðŸ“§
```
playlistcleanergdautomation@pro-course-469119-d5.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

## Next Steps
1. Create/configure shared drive (5 minutes)
2. Re-run the test script
3. Integration will work automatically in containers

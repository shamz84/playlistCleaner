# System Update Summary - Downloaded File Integration

## 🎯 Changes Made

### **Primary Goal**
Replaced all references to `raw_playlist_20.m3u` with `downloaded_file.m3u` to use the dynamically downloaded playlist file instead of relying on a static source file.

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. **Download Script** (`download_file.py`)
- **Change**: Updated `download_direct()` function to output `downloaded_file.m3u` instead of `manual_download.m3u`
- **Impact**: Downloads now create the primary playlist file used by the filter

### 2. **Filter Script** (`filter_comprehensive.py`)
- **Change**: Updated to read from `downloaded_file.m3u` instead of `raw_playlist_20.m3u`
- **Change**: Updated processing logic to handle `downloaded_file` in filename detection
- **Change**: Removed duplicate file reading section for downloaded files
- **Impact**: Filter now processes the dynamically downloaded playlist as the main source

### 3. **Main Pipeline** (`process_playlist_complete.py`)
- **Change**: Updated required files check to look for `downloaded_file.m3u` instead of `raw_playlist_20.m3u`
- **Change**: Updated download validation to check for `downloaded_file.m3u`
- **Change**: Updated troubleshooting messages
- **Impact**: Pipeline now validates and uses the correct downloaded file

### 4. **Container Configuration** (`docker-entrypoint.sh`)
- **Change**: Updated file validation to check for `downloaded_file.m3u`
- **Change**: Updated output copying to include `downloaded_file.m3u`
- **Impact**: Container properly validates and exports the downloaded file

### 5. **Docker Compose** (`docker-compose.yml`)
- **Change**: Commented out `raw_playlist_20.m3u` volume mounts
- **Impact**: Container no longer requires static playlist file mounting

## 🚀 System Behavior Changes

### **Before Update**
- System used `raw_playlist_20.m3u` as primary source
- Downloaded files went to `manual_download.m3u` (used as secondary source)
- Required static playlist file to be present

### **After Update**
- System uses `downloaded_file.m3u` as primary source (downloaded dynamically)
- No longer requires static `raw_playlist_20.m3u` file
- Fully dynamic - downloads fresh playlist data on each run

## 📊 Test Results

### **Local Testing**
```
✅ Download: downloaded_file.m3u (3.6MB, 27,644 lines)
✅ Filter: 7,179 entries included from 91 groups
✅ Credentials: 2 personalized playlists generated
⏱️  Total time: 1.47 seconds
```

### **Container Testing**
```
✅ Download: downloaded_file.m3u (3.6MB)
✅ Filter: 7,179 entries processed
✅ Credentials: 8k_sparmar.m3u (1.9MB), 8k_sparmar2.m3u (1.9MB)
✅ Export: All files copied to /app/data
⏱️  Total time: 1.05 seconds
```

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **Dynamic Content**: Always processes the latest playlist data from the server
2. **Simplified Setup**: No need to maintain static playlist files
3. **Container Efficiency**: Reduced volume mounts, cleaner configuration
4. **Consistent Naming**: Clear distinction between downloaded and processed files
5. **Error Reduction**: Eliminates issues with outdated static files

## 📁 Generated Files

The system now generates:
- `downloaded_file.m3u` - Fresh playlist data from server
- `filtered_playlist_final.m3u` - Filtered and ordered playlist
- `8k_[username].m3u` - Personalized playlists with credentials
- All files exported to `data/` directory in container

## 🔧 Usage

### **Local Run**
```bash
python process_playlist_complete.py --skip-gdrive
```

### **Container Run**
```bash
podman run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  -v $(pwd)/raw_playlist_AsiaUk.m3u:/app/raw_playlist_AsiaUk.m3u:ro \
  -v $(pwd)/credentials.json:/app/credentials.json:ro \
  -v $(pwd)/group_titles_with_flags.json:/app/group_titles_with_flags.json:ro \
  -e SKIP_GDRIVE="--skip-gdrive" \
  playlist-processor:latest
```

**Note**: No longer need to mount `raw_playlist_20.m3u` - system downloads fresh data automatically!

## ✅ Status: Complete

All changes have been implemented and tested successfully. The system now operates entirely on dynamically downloaded playlist data while maintaining all existing functionality for filtering, credential replacement, and optional Google Drive backup.

# Google Drive Service Account Setup - SOLUTION REQUIRED

> Archived troubleshooting record only. Verify current service-account support and permissions before using any steps below; see [current Drive guidance](../README_GoogleDrive.md).

## Current Status ✅
- ✅ Service account is properly configured 
- ✅ Authentication is working correctly
- ✅ Google Drive API is accessible

## Issue Identified 🚨
**Service accounts cannot upload to their own Google Drive storage**

Error: `Service Accounts do not have storage quota. Leverage shared drives instead.`

## Solution Required 🔧

### Option 1: Create Shared Drive (Recommended)
1. **Go to Google Drive** (drive.google.com)
2. **Create a new Shared Drive:**
   - Click "New" → "Shared drive"
   - Name it: `PlaylistCleaner-Backup`
3. **Add service account as member:**
   - Click "Add members"
   - Enter: `playlistcleanergdautomation@pro-course-469119-d5.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - Set role: **Editor** or **Content manager**
   - Click "Send"

### Option 2: Use Existing Shared Drive
1. Open any existing shared drive
2. Add the service account email as Editor
3. Update the configuration

## After Setup 🚀

Once you've created and shared the drive, run:
```bash
C:/Python311/python.exe test_service_account_shared_drive.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Detect the shared drive automatically
- ✅ Test upload functionality
- ✅ Save configuration for future use

## Service Account Email 📧
```
playlistcleanergdautomation@pro-course-469119-d5.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

## Next Steps
1. Create/configure shared drive (5 minutes)
2. Re-run the test script
3. Integration will work automatically in containers
